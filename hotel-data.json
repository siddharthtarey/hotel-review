Housekeeping knocked on my door at 8am to ask if I was checking out when check out is at 12. at 11:30 I asked for a late check out and the frigid front desk clerk told me no because I wasn't an Elite Diamond Member for the rewards program, I also mentioned I work for a Choice Hotels property and she told me it didnt matter. I then proceeded to grab a pamphlet which EVERY brand of Choice Hotel's has and show her in writing that any level member of Choice Priveleges is entitled to a late checkout, and she told me that they should take it out of there because their property doesn't do it, \"Are you serious???\" (Keep in mind that 6000 properties have this same pamphlet and honor the program but hers should be exempt according to her). I walked back up to my room and I get a call offering the late check out after I walked away angrily. I get back up stars and at 12:15 and with a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in my door, housekeeping knocked again. I pulled the sign out of the door and asked housekeeping to read it. At this point I was so mad, I forgot about the 30 min nap I wanted to take before driving back home 3 hours, and they knock and call again 10 minutes later to see if I am out of the room.

The Motel has a small pool and whirlpool and provides some light refreshment in the morning, but not a breakfast - there is an adjoining Roadhouse Restaurant providing meals throughout the day which seemed quite good.

A minor bug is the hot water in the shower was not consistent. You had to be on the ready to adjust every minute as it would seem to fade away. Another minor annoyance is that we booked the room for 4 people and it was only stocked with 3 bath towels. I'm not in the hotel business but there has to be a way to match the room stock to the customer coming in. Anyway no big deal again to go to the front desk and ask for another towel. The noise level could be a bother to some. You are right next to the freeway and the airport and can clearly hear both in the evening quiet. We live near railroad tracks at home so we are accustomed to noise and weren't bothered by it but you could be if you are a light sleeper. The biggest downer was the front desk friendliness. There seemed to be a cloud of gloom hanging over a couple of the people working the desk while a couple others at least tried but seemed to be restrained by the gloom and doomers around them. At least crack a smile for the love of pete. The shuttle to the airport was nice and the driver was very courteous and friendly. He should be in charge of the front desk.

We needed four single rooms total. When first walking into the lobby we were told they could accommodate us. After a few minutes of deciding where to stay we went back in and were told they only had one single available. We negotiated and were able to get doubles for the price of a single. All of us got our room keys, and proceeded to get baggage out of the rental car. 3/4 of the keys didn't actually unlock any doors, and we were told it was due to being too close to electronics. The one key that did work had 115 written on it. We open the door to 115, there is luggage open on the beds and the shower is running. (Good thing we didn't catch a glance) Returned to office and told them of the situation and she said, \"Sorry, were doing training and you were supposed to get 215.\" The lock to another one of our rooms still wouldn't unlock. They switched that room to 219. Our manager was uncomfortable with having an adjoining room to another room where we didn't know someone. So we switched 215 to 220. After driving 13 hours to Peoria, we all were in need of rest. After waking we found the towels were dirty, there were cigarette burns in a non-smoking room, and upon close inspection there was blood splatter on the walls, carpet, and curtains. The security latch in 219 was also separating from the door. The drain and stopper were missing from the bathtub. The grout in the bathroom looks like it hasn't been scrubbed since the place was built. There was a coffee pot, but no coffee. I told the attendant in the office about our experience at checkout and she said, \"Well you should have came down first thing to let us know about the problem.\" I'm sorry but after driving for half a day I'm not going to inspect our room, go down to the office, and have them switch the room once again.. But I guess next time I know. Not that next time we will stay at the Super 8.

Surprised you can hear it, no one else by you complained.\" No apology. No move to another room. No nothing. I'm checking out early in the morning.

It was not until when I went to check in after a day of travelling that I was informed. Kim at the front desk was wonderful, got Cheap Tickets on the phone for me, looked at their listing on their website and ensured a refund. I did stay for one night since it was so late by that time. It appears to have been a grand hotel in its day. There were many maintenance issues reported as I stood at the front desk on hold with Cheap Tickets for 1/2 an hour and then for another 1/2 hour once I finallly got a person. (I will review Cheap Tickets in a separate one) The staff at the hotel were very accomodating and attended to the maintenance issues quickly, I believe that they had their hands full. The pool area was gorgeous. There are elevators. The rooms have balconies, but without tables or chairs. The rooms have a fridge and a microwave. I never did get any hot water in the bathroom sink, and was only able to have a bath after getting some help getting a plug and some instructions on how to get water in the bath (turn more than 5 times). I was given a cable to hook up to internet in my room, but I was able to get a bar of wifi in there in which to search for another hotel. Kim saved the day.

Based on the reviews (cleanness and great breakfast) is why I went with it. I'm not super picky in other areas, that's mainly what I look for, BUT BIG MISTAKE for ignoring other \"cons\" mentioned.... Room: first the room was clean but more like a \"remodel\" type of clean looks like walls were painted over and you could still see the dirt under the paint. Sinks looked like they didn't use a good cleaner and just wasn't very clean, it was more of a surface clean. A couple of people mentioned it being small. Well it was tiny and hard to even change with privacy. There was no room around the sink, the only door was to the toilet and shower and then to go out. It is way to crammed for a family. The beds were comfortable and they had good selection of towels. I liked that they gave you an option to pick your services everyday. Breakfast: I liked it and I'd say that was very good: homemade waffles, sausage, gravy, biscuits, a lot of toast, eggs, hash browns, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, juice-it was excellent but the same everyday and it was a little small and crowded. Staff was very nice and helpful with breakfast. Front desk people were not very helpful but nothing worth complaining about. Not good: the walls were so thin I could literally hear the neighbor \"peeing\" in his restroom in the very early of the morning, we could here when someone took a shower (water turning on and running) we could also hear all the people outside (talking, walking, driving) plus the windows did not lock.

There is only a small typical hotel room table and 3 chairs, so for eating the meals you have cooked all together can cause a certain logistic problem. The kitchenet is not fully equiped. The kitchen tools are very basic, very small stove, no oven. For pots and pan, ask at the desk because they do not let them in the suite because people steal them.

The elevator is dirty and looks more like a service elevator than one for guests. Our room smelled of smoke, eventhough we asked for non-smoking. The pool area at this property was not properly maintained. While I was there, a little paper sign stated the Spa was not working, but children and adults still used it. If the spa was off limits, they should have covered or roped it off to prevent people from using it. Sunday morning, the pool deck was littered with beer cans and trash. It was not cleaned up until about 10 am. There was no sign on or around the pool area for the hours of the pool and spa-at 7:30 am there were kids and adults in the pool. At that time the deep end was cloudy. I went to the front desk and asked them when the pool got cleaned. They said he would be there. Sometime after 10 am I noticed the pool had turned green and you could not see the bottom of the deep end. The pool guy finally got there and I spoke to the him. He said he could not correct the problem and I went back to front desk to discuss the pool and asked for a discount on my stay as I clearly would not have stayed there without a pool. They gave me $10 off, but with attitude! I still paid more for this hotel than one without a pool. The on-site manager told me it was inspected this morning and they would not be closing the pool as it was fine.

I knew the manager lied about a serious public health problem. The last date this pool was inspected by the county was September 2011. No inspection occured on Sunday, the County told me they don't work on the weekends. You do not lie to customers to make them happy, especially about a public safety issue.
